147,"the negative relationship between increasing autumnal temperatures and mussel growth may result from attempting to grow (driven by an increased metabolism) at a time of limited food quality and quantity, resulting in an overall net loss of energy and a decrease in the ability to put on weight or increase shell length.",1,0,0
148,"in addition to the stress of high temperatures, species u. tumidus and u. pictorum already have high metabolic demands during the autumn due to the energy requirement of tissue histolysis and histogenesis following their summer spawning period (mann, 1979; aldridge, 1999).",1,1,0

150,it is important to note that an increase in growth rate does not necessarily indicate a healthier population.,0,0,1
151,"although increases in nutrients and phytoplankton (following temperature rises) promote increased growth rates in mussels, these higher growth rates can result in reduced longevity, abundance, and species richness (haag and rypel, 2011; ridgway et al., 2011; fritts et al., 2017).",1,1,0
